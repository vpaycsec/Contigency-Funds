    <h2>What are Contigency Funds?</h2>
    <p>A Contigency fund is a crucial financial safety net designed to cover unexpected expenses such as medical emergencies, car repairs, or job loss. It helps ensure financial stability during uncertain times. Financial experts recommend having an Contigency fund in place before investing or taking on significant debt.</p>
    
    <h2>Why Do You Need a Contigency Fund?</h2>
    <p>Life is unpredictable, and emergencies can arise at any moment. Whether it‚Äôs an unplanned medical expense, a natural disaster, or an unforeseen job loss, an emergency fund provides peace of mind. Without it, you might be forced to rely on credit cards or loans, which can lead to further financial strain. Experts advise that an emergency fund should be a priority for financial security.</p>

    <h2>The 70-20-10 Rule</h2>
    <p>The 70-20-10 rule is a simple financial strategy that helps with saving and investment. According to this rule:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>70% of your Contigency fund should be invested in Fixed Deposits (FD), which must be easily withdrawable.</li>
      <li>20% should go into your bank savings account.</li>
      <li>10% should be kept in hand as cash for immediate needs.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Contigency Funds Calculation</h3>
    <p>Your Contigency fund must be 6 times your monthly income. The rule of 70-20-10 will help you distribute your funds accordingly.</p>
